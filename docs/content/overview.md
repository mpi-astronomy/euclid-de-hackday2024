The workshop will focus on the early Euclid Data Release and how to hack it. This event will be a one-day workshop and unconference, where we will discuss and learn from each other about the finer details of the Euclid mission data and use them in various contexts. We hope this workshop could lead to some new collaborations or initial joint studies. We want to dedicate a significant amount of time to unconference sessions and informal discussions.
