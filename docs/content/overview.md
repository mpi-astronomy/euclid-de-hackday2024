MPIA will host a Hack Day focused on the early Euclid Data Release on June 12. This event will be a one-day workshop, where we will discuss and learn from each other about data access, formats as well as the finer details of the Euclid mission data. Expert on the data will be present to answer questions. We hope this workshop could lead to some new collaborations or initial joint studies. We plan to dedicate a significant amount of time to work sessions and informal discussions. The exact location will be announced later.
